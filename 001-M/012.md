# ChainLink's `latestRoundData` might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
In `GLPOracle` we are using a call to `latestRoundData`, however there are not sufficient checks in place to prevent stale data from being used.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `getEthPrice`, `roundId` is not checked against `answeredInRound`. According to ChainLink documentation, this may result in stale prices, even though `updatedAt` is checked.

## Impact
A stale price would potentially lead to assets being mispriced and risk profiles being miscalculated, preventing the protocol from working as intended.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sentimentxyz/oracle/blob/rage-jr/src/gmx/GLPOracle.sol#L47-L58
```solidity
function getEthPrice() internal view returns (uint) {
    (, int answer,, uint updatedAt,) =
        ethUsdPriceFeed.latestRoundData();

    if (block.timestamp - updatedAt >= 86400)
        revert Errors.StalePrice(address(0), address(ethUsdPriceFeed));

    if (answer <= 0)
        revert Errors.NegativePrice(address(0), address(ethUsdPriceFeed));

    return uint(answer);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update `getEthPrice` to include an extra check for stale price:
```solidity
function getEthPrice() internal view returns (uint) {
    (uint80 roundId, int answer,, uint updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) =
        ethUsdPriceFeed.latestRoundData();

    if (block.timestamp - updatedAt >= 86400 || answeredInRound < roundId)
        revert Errors.StalePrice(address(0), address(ethUsdPriceFeed));

    if (answer <= 0)
        revert Errors.NegativePrice(address(0), address(ethUsdPriceFeed));

    return uint(answer);
}
```
