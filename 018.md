# Unapproved Accounts will revert until approved

## Summary

Each new user `account` will get reverts until plutusDAO approves them.

## Vulnerability Detail

The call from `AccountManager` -> `Account.exec` will revert until PlutusDAO approves each account contract individually

This will prevent them from using the token, while it may be active as an asset

## Impact

The integration will require an extra manual step, for it to be usable by specific accounts

```solidity
  function _isEligibleSender() private view {
    if (
      msg.sender != tx.origin && whitelist.isWhitelisted(msg.sender) == false && partners[msg.sender].isActive == false
    ) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Discuss with PlutusDAO for ways to automate the approval
