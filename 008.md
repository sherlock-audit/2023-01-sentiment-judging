# GMX RewardRouter's compound() function does not return WETH

## Summary

When `compound()` is called, the RewardRouterController accounts for `WETH` as an incoming token. However, when GMX rewards are compounded, all value stays in the protocol and no tokens are withdrawn. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When a Sentiment account calls `compound()` on the GMX Reward Router, the Controller accounts for WETH being returned to the account:

```solidity
function canCallCompound()
    internal
    view
    returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
{
    return (true, WETH, new address[](0));
}
```

When `compound()` is called, the following two functions in GMX's Reward Router are called:

```solidity
    function _compoundGmx(address _account) private {
        uint256 esGmxAmount = IRewardTracker(stakedGmxTracker).claimForAccount(_account, _account);
        if (esGmxAmount > 0) {
            _stakeGmx(_account, _account, esGmx, esGmxAmount);
        }

        uint256 bnGmxAmount = IRewardTracker(bonusGmxTracker).claimForAccount(_account, _account);
        if (bnGmxAmount > 0) {
            IRewardTracker(feeGmxTracker).stakeForAccount(_account, _account, bnGmx, bnGmxAmount);
        }
    }

    function _compoundGlp(address _account) private {
        uint256 esGmxAmount = IRewardTracker(stakedGlpTracker).claimForAccount(_account, _account);
        if (esGmxAmount > 0) {
            _stakeGmx(_account, _account, esGmx, esGmxAmount);
        }
    }
```

As you can see, in both of these functions, once WETH has been claimed, the full amount is immediately staked back into the protocol. To confirm this, I wrote up a Foundry test that forks Arbitrum mainnet and compounds, verifying that a user's WETH balance does not increase. 

[You can find the test ready to copy & paste here.](https://gist.github.com/zobront/5eeeab9367613f7a46522c613eb1acd7)

## Impact

WETH will be added as an asset in the user's account, even if it shouldn't be.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove WETH from the tokensIn when `compound()` is called:

```diff
function canCallCompound()
    internal
    view
    returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
{
-    return (true, WETH, new address[](0));
+    return (true, new address[](0), new address[](0));
}
```
