# Use of controller `DNGMXVaultController` for two separate contracts with different functions

## Summary
`DNGMXVaultController` must be deployed twice to control calls to two separate contracts `withdrawPeriphery` and `depositPeriphery`. While this poses no issues, it can be confusing.

## Vulnerability Detail
`DNGMXVaultController` controls calls to the function `depositToken(address,address,uint256)` of [`depositPeriphery`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7ca90dd6813256bd040a8e13bbced857b1c0c90c#writeContract) and to functions `redeemToken(address,address,uint256)` and `withdrawToken(address,address,uint256)` of [`withdrawPeriphery`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xBA55D7f67Fa22DF5E92487d5b306DdB1aA543d10#writeContract). 
It must be deployed twice, one contract for each Perphery.
It can be confusing for someone looking at the chain to have functions for `withdrawPeriphery` in the controller of `depositPeriphery` and vice-versa.

## Impact
Can be confusing to have a controller which contains checks for functions that are not present in the target integration.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using two different contracts for controlling calls to `withdrawPeriphery` and to `depositPeriphery`, each containing only the checks to the functions to be called on the target integration.
