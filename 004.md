# GMX RewardRouterV2 allows redeeming to a different address, leading to incorrect tokensIn

## Summary

GMX's `unstakeAndRedeemGlp()` function allows a withdrawer to withdraw their tokens to a `receiver` account that isn't their own, while the corresponding Controller assumes that all tokens are withdrawn to the Sentiment account that called the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The RewardRouterV2Controller.sol contract interacts with GMX's RewardRouterV2 contract. One of the permitted functions is `unstakeAndRedeemGlp()`, which takes the following arguments:

`unstakeAndRedeemGlp(address _tokenOut, uint256 _glpAmount, uint256 _minOut, address _receiver)`

The `receiver` argument specifies where the withdrawn tokens should be sent, which can be any address.

The RewardRouterV2Controller's `canCallRedeem()` function incorrectly assumes that the specified tokens will be withdrawn to the user's Sentiment account, regardless of the address entered as the receiver.

## Impact

Accounting on user accounts can be thrown off (intentionally or unintentionally), resulting in mismatches between their assets array and hasAsset mapping and the reality of their account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When decoding the data from the call to GMX, confirm that `receiver == msg.sender`.

```diff
function canCallRedeem(bytes calldata data)
    internal
    view
    returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
{
    address[] memory tokensIn = new address[](1);
-    (tokensIn[0],,,) = abi.decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, uint256));
+    (tokensIn[0],,,address receiver) = abi.decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, address));
+    if (receiver != msg.sender) return (true, new address[](0), sGLP);

    return (true, tokensIn, sGLP);
}
```

Note: The decoding is currently slightly off, as it decodes the final value as a `uint256`: `(tokensIn[0],,,) = abi.decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, uint256));`

However, the function has the following signature: `unstakeAndRedeemGlp(address _tokenOut,uint256 _glpAmount,uint256 _minOut,address _receiver)`

This will need to be adjusted if you follow the recommendation above to use the `receiver` value.
