# RewardRouterV2Controller decoding is slightly off

The `canCallRedeem()` function in RewardRouterV2Controller.sol performs the following decoding:

`(tokensIn[0],,,) = abi.decode(data, (address, uint256, uint256, uint256));`

However, the function has the following signature:

`unstakeAndRedeemGlp(address _tokenOut,uint256 _glpAmount,uint256 _minOut,address _receiver)`

I wouldn't normally submit this, since you don't use that part of the decoding, but one of my other issues has a recommendation that the receiver is used, so I wanted to highlight that this fix is necessary.
