# `depositAll()` should use `fsGLP` as the tokensOut in `PLVGLPController`

## Summary

`depositAll()` is one of the functions specified in the `PLVGLPController` controller for deposits. The `tokensOut` used is `sGLP` instead of the preferred `fsGLP` .

## Vulnerability Detail

The Plutus GLP Depositor contract exposes the `depositAll()` function as follows:

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13F0D29b5B83654A200E4540066713d50547606E#code

```solidity
  function depositAll() external {
    deposit(fsGLP.balanceOf(msg.sender));
  }
```

This function uses the balance of `fsGLP` to determine how much `sGLP` will be deposited. 

The `PLVGLPController` of Sentiment however tracks tokensOut as `sGLP`.

```solidity
    function canCall(address, bool, bytes calldata data)
        external
        view
        returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
    {
        bytes4 sig = bytes4(data);

        if (sig == DEPOSIT || sig == DEPOSIT_ALL) {
            return (true, PLVGLP, sGLP);
        }
```

Note: `fsGLP` and `sGLP` have different token addresses but are both transferred to an account after a `RewardRouterV2Controller::mintAndStakeGlp` transaction.

```solidity
  IERC20 public constant fsGLP = IERC20(0x1aDDD80E6039594eE970E5872D247bf0414C8903);
  IERC20 public constant sGLP = IERC20(0x2F546AD4eDD93B956C8999Be404cdCAFde3E89AE);
```

To accurately track balances, the `fsGLP` token should be used instead.

## Impact

For functions such as depositAll() which rely on token balances, `fsGLP` ensures accurate balancing tracking within the protocol and avoids accounting issues.
