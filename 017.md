# `GLP` has a 15 minute cooldown after purchase that is not accounted for

## Summary

`PLVGLPController` manages the deposit of `sGLP` for the Plutus GLP Vault. Deposits will fail unless 15 minutes have passed after every purchase of `sGLP`.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to Plutus Docs,  "After buying `GLP` there is a 15 minute cooldown before being able to deposit for `plvGLP`". This is due to functionality built directly into `GLP` - https://plutusdao-1.gitbook.io/plutus-docs/products/plvassets/plvglp.

`PLVGLPController` has no checks for this and will therefore return `true` for the `canCall` function even when the 15 minute cooldown hasn't passed.

```solidity
     function canCall(address, bool, bytes calldata data)
        external
        view
        returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
    {
        bytes4 sig = bytes4(data);

        if (sig == DEPOSIT || sig == DEPOSIT_ALL) {
            return (true, PLVGLP, sGLP);
        }
```

## Impact

Operations involve sGLP are likely to constantly fail within the cooldown periods.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a timestamp check whenever sGLP is purchased by an account. This timestamp can then be used to check whether 15 minutes have passed before a further transfer of the sGLP is done.
