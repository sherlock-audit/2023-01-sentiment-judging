# `updatedAt` from `latestRoundData()`  can still be stale for less then a day and an attacker can steal funds

## Summary
When a round is stale for less than a day and the price falls, an attacker can use this to their advantage by arbitrating/selling these holds. If the opposite happens an attacker can buy up a lot of tokens at a lower price and then sell them at a higher price.
## Vulnerability Detail
ex:
day 1: the round is stale and the price for eth is 1200
and in the real world eth price went up to 1500
 an attacker can buy up all supply and then sell at a higher market for profit.

## Impact
Loss  to protocol and oracle will give stale pricing 
## Code Snippet
```solidity

        if (block.timestamp - updatedAt >= 86400)
            revert Errors.StalePrice(address(0), address(ethUsdPriceFeed));


```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check this to 
add this to the `latestRoundData()
```solidity
 (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();

        require(answer > 0, "invalid_oracle_answer");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");
        require(timestamp > 0, "ChainLink: Round not complete");
```
to make sure no round is stale and the update to the round happened instead of determining it through time.
