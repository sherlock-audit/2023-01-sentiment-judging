# `manager.getPrice(false)` returns lower value than if it was true,which  an attacker can take advantage of it

## Summary
`manager.getPrice(false)` returns a lower value than if it was true which is then a lower price that an attacker can take advantage of it
## Vulnerability Detail
In the gmx docs:
>The price of GLP is based on the total worth of all tokens in the pool and factors in pending profits and losses from all currently opened positions.
Buy price: glpManager.getPrice(true)
Sell price: glpManager.getPrice(false)
Since there might be a spread for token pricing, passing in true into the getPrice function returns the maximum price at that point in time, while passing in false returns the minimum price.
***
Because `getPrice(false)` can be a lower value an attacker can take advantage of the smaller price and cause a loss to the protocol.
ex:(pseudo example)
`getPrice(false)=2000`
`getPrice(true)=3000`
If an attacker can buy tokens with the `getPrice(false)`  they will get a discount and not pay `3000` per token 
## Impact
loss of funds 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
return manager.getPrice(false) / (getEthPrice() * 1e4);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
return `getPrice(true)` or you can have a parm that specifies buying or selling and figure out the price that way
