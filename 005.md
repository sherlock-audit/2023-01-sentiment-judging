# All Rage Trade functions allow sending tokens to a different address, leading to incorrect tokensIn

## Summary

All three approved functions on Rage Trade (`depositTokens()`, `withdrawTokens()` and `redeemTokens()`) allow for a `receiver` argument to be included, which sends the resulting tokens to that address. The corresponding Controller assumes that all tokens are withdrawn to the Sentiment account that called the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The three functions that can be called on Rage Trade have the following signatures:
- depositToken(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount)
- redeemToken(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount)
- withdrawToken(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount)

Each of these functions contains a `receiver` argument, which can be passed any address that will receive the outputted tokens. 

The DNGMXVaultController incorrectly assumes in all cases that the outputted tokens will be received by the Sentiment account in question, regardless of what is entered as a receiver.

## Impact

Accounting on user accounts can be thrown off (intentionally or unintentionally), resulting in mismatches between their assets array and hasAsset mapping and the reality of their account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When decoding the data from the call to Rage Trade, confirm that receiver == msg.sender. Here's an example with the deposit function:

```diff
function canDeposit(bytes calldata data)
    internal
    view
    returns (bool, address[] memory, address[] memory)
{
    (address token, address receiver,) = abi.decode(
        data, (address, address, uint256)
    );
+   if (receiver != msg.sender) return (true, vault, new address[](0));

    address[] memory tokensOut = new address[](1);
    tokensOut[0] = token;

    return (true, vault, tokensOut);
}
```
