# Risk with Liquidation - Because of partnership requirement, caller may be unable to redeem during liquidation making it less likely for them to be willing to perform the liquidation

## Summary

Due to the approval system with pvGLP, liquidations may be less likely



## Vulnerability Detail

In times of intense price action, a liquidation may have to be performed on pvGLP.

The protocol will offer `liquidate` which will sweep funds out, this is fine and will work as intended because it relies on `transferFrom`.

However, a liquidator will receive the vault token, and may be unable to redeem it.

That's because redemptions have to be performed via [`plvGLP depositor`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13F0D29b5B83654A200E4540066713d50547606E#code) which may not have approved the liquidators account.

This will make it less likely for liquidators to perform the operation as it may force either a manual operation (redemption can be performed by any EOA), or it will require further setup, reducing the number of operators willing to perform the liquidation in the time of need.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function _isEligibleSender() private view {
    if (
      msg.sender != tx.origin && whitelist.isWhitelisted(msg.sender) == false && partners[msg.sender].isActive == false
    ) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
  }
```
